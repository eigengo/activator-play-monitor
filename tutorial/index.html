    <title>Play Framework (Scala) with Monitoring - Activator Template</title>
</head>

<div>
    <p>
        You've just created a simple Scala Play Framework application with Monitoring!
    </p>
    <p>
        This activator template is based on <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/activator-hello-play-scala">activator-hello-play-scala<a/>
        and adds monitoring using the excellent <a href="">monitor tool</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>View the App</h2>

    <p>
        Once the application has been compiled and the server started, your application can be accessed at: <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a><br/>
        Check in <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> to see the server status.<br/>
        When you make an HTTP request to that URL, the Play server figures out what code to execute which will handle the request and return a response.  In this application the request handler for requests to the root URL (e.g. "/") are handled by a Java Controller.  You can use Java and Scala to create your controllers.<br/>
        Controllers asynchronously return HTTP responses of any content type (i.e. HTML, JSON, binary).

    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
    <h3>Artifacts</h3>
    <p>
        Two dependencies have been added to <code>build.sbt</code> to enable monitoring.  Firstly there's <code>org.eigengo.monitor:agent-play</code>
        which contains the code to inject monitoring points.  Secondly there's <code>org.eigengo.monitor:output-statsd</code> which provides
        output of the monitoring to statsd.
    </p>
    <h3>Statsd</h3>
    <p>
        In order to see the monitoring data, e.g. the `play.request.count` it will be necessary to run `statsd`.  This application
        has been successfully tested against <a href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/dogstatsd">Datadog's statsd agent</a>.
        With datadog it is possible to view the stats on a pretty dashboard so it makes for an excellent choice.
    </p>
    <h3>Java agent</h3>
    <p>
        Since the monitoring depends upon aspectj to weave in the monitoring points it is necessary to configure aspectj as
        a Java agent on the JVM running the application.  When running the application via the Play build tool this can be achieved
        by adding an environment variable called <code>PLAY_OPTS</code>.  Let's say you had the aspectj weaver library
        within your home directory
        and your username was joeb, then your variable would look something like this:
        <code><pre>
            -javaagent:/Users/joeb/aspectjweaver-1.7.3.jar
        </pre></code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Naturally, if you are already using this environment variable,
        the <code>-javaagent</code> part can simply be appended.
    </p>
    <p>
        When your Play app is run in production, most likely via the dist zip, then you will need to ensure the javaagent switch is
        passed to the start script to enable monitoring. See
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ProductionConfiguration">
                Play's Production Configuration documentation
        </a>
        for more details

    <h2>Monitor configuration</h2>
    <p>
        To configure the monitoring it has been necessary to add two files on the classpath:
    <ul>
        <li><code>META-INF/monitor/agent.conf</code></li>
        <li><code>META-INF/monitor/output.conf</code></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>agent.conf</h3>
    <p>
        This file contains the settings for the monitoring agent such as output class name and the name of the agent.  Currently,
        there aren't any specific settings for the play agent but it is likely that filters will be added to suppress counting
        requests to certain URLs.
    </p>
    <h3>output.conf</h3>
    <p>
        This file contains the settings for the statsd output such as <code>remoteAddress</code> and <code>remotePort</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>Optional: META-INF/aop.xml</h3>
    <p>
        Note that you can optionally include an <code>aop.xml</code> file.  This is useful when you want to tell aspectj to
        print details of the load-time weaving to the console.
